/*
 * Properties are used to provide access to class instance variables in other classes.
 *
 * - assign : Itâ€™s used to assign a new value to the property anytime
 * - nonatomic : Thread access is faster. But we cannot simultaneously access and change the value
 * - readonly : We cannot directly assign new values to these properties
 * - copy : The value assigned to the property can be copied and used for other purposes
 * - readwrite : We can read and change the value of a property
 * - strong : We have direct control over the lifetime of the property
 * - weak : We can nullify the property and so can the compiler
